✨ Features

· 📝 Wave Language – Write music in .wave format
· 🎨 Real-time Visualization – Animated waves with visual feedback
· 🔊 Binary Sounds – bit (low) and blop (high) audio synthesis
· ⚡ Live Coding – Changes update instantly
· 💾 File Management – Save/Load .wave compositions

🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and run
git clone https://github.com/LonelyStudentProf/LambdaSynth-Studio.git
cd LambdaSynth-Studio
pip install -r requirements.txt
python lambdasynth.py
```

📖 Wave Language Basics

```wave
# Syntax: #id λ=wavelength v=velocity f=frequency color sound1 sound2...

# Example
#1 λ=0.8 v=340 f=425 #FF0000 bit
#2 λ=0.5 v=340 f=680 #00FF00 blop blop
```

Sound Types

· bit = Low pitch (220Hz sine wave)
· blop = High pitch (440Hz triangle wave)

🎮 Controls

Key Action
SPACE Play/Pause
R Reset
S Save
L Load
+/- Tempo
M Mute
ESC Exit

🎵 Examples

Simple Rhythm

```wave
#1 λ=0.2 v=340 f=1700 #000000 bit bit bit
#2 λ=0.25 v=340 f=1360 #666666 blop
```

Arpeggio

```wave
#1 λ=0.8 v=340 f=261 #FF0000 bit
#2 λ=0.67 v=340 f=329 #FF7F00 bit
#3 λ=0.6 v=340 f=392 #FFFF00 blop
```
